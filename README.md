# meta-doc
META Doc is modern tool for generating rich project documentations using Markdown or HTML with support of various visual styles and custom templates.

## Getting started

Install via NPM:

```bash
npm install meta-doc -g
```

Create new documentation project using default skeleton:

```bash
meta-doc -i ./my-doc
```

Start local server and automatically recompile when content change:

```bash
meta-doc -w -s ./my-doc
```

Congratulations, you have running documentation. Open it at [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/) and check out Writer's Guide.

To compile documentation once without server just execute:

```bash
meta-doc ./my-doc
```
